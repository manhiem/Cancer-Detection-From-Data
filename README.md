# Cancer-Detection-From-Data

The key challenge in cancer detection is how to classify tumors into malignant or benign machine learning techniques can dramatically improve the accuracy of diagnosis.
Research indicates that most experienced physicians can diagnose cancer with 79 percent accuracy while 91 percent correct diagnosis is achieved using machine learning techniques.
In this project, the task is to classify tumors into malignant or benign tumors using features of tumors from several cell images.
